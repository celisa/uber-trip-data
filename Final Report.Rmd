## Abstract
New York City is known for heavy traffic congestion, and with the rise of ride-sharing services in the past decade, it's becoming increasingly important to understand how ride pickup services impact the traffic flow in New York City. In this report, we aim to understand whether the number of Uber pickup rides vary depending on the weather conditions, and whether Uber services increased the number of traffic collision deaths in New York City. We are going to work with data on Uber pickup rides in New York City between the months January - June in 2015 as well as weather condition dataset sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which contains daily data on temperature, precipitation, snow depth, and wind strength. We also obtained data on traffic collision deaths in New York City sourced from NYPD. <KEY RESULTS>

## Introduction
In this report, we would in particular like to research the following two questions: Q1) do weather conditions have an impact on the number of Uber pickup rides in New York City? and Q2) Did the introduction of Uber in 2015 increase the number of traffic collision deaths in New York City (yes / no)? We will be building a predictive model to estimate the number of Uber rides given the weather conditions and traffic collision information on a given day to estimate how these factors influence the traffic flow in New York City. The data for Uber rides was obtained from NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) <INCLUDE APA STYLE CITATION> and ... <FINISH UP OTHER DATA SOURCES> 

## Methods
- Describe the process you used to conduct analysis:
  - EDA
  - data cleaning (e.g., did you exclude missing values? If so, how many? Did you collapse
    categories for any variables?) 
  - describe the models you fit, and any changes you made to improve
    model fit (e.g., did you exclude any influential points? Did you do have to address multicollinearity issues? Did you transform any variables?). Feature selection? Explain the rationale for choosing this specific model. 
  - describe model diagnostics. The organization of this section may depend on your particular dataset/analysis, but you may want to break it into subsections
    such as “Data,” “Models,” and “Model assessment.” R squared-value? Model assumptions valid?

## Results
- Here you should present results for all aspects of the analysis. The structure of this section
should mirror the structure of the methods section. For example, you can start with a few key EDA
results (e.g., a table of descriptive statistics), then present model results, then address assessment.
This is the section where you will primarily refer to tables and figures. You should have at least 1
figure for each research question that illustrates a key result of the analysis.

## Conclusion
- Describe the key takeaways from your analysis, limitations, and future work that can be
done to advance knowledge in this area
